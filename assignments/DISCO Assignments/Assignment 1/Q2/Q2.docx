Given a bijection f: S → S, where S is the set of natural numbers upto 100. Find the inverse of the function.

INPUT:

100 consecutive lines containing space separated integers M and N. Followed by T test cases for identifying inverse.

1 <= M <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
1 <= T <= 100

OUTPUT:

Pre-image of every number given its image.

Example 1:

(for case of S containing numbers 1 to 5)
INPUT:

2 3
1 4
5 2
3 1
4 5
3  //number of test cases
1
4
2

OUTPUT:
3
1
5

Explanation: 3 is the preimage of 1. 1 is the preimage of 4 and so on.
