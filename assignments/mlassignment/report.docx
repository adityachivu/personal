NaiveBayes() function used, present in the e1071 library.

Accuracy is 55.8%

R functions used:
1. readChar – parse text file into a list containing single char vector.
2. strplit, unlist – format parsed text file into usable format.
3. replace, as.numeric, as.factor – convert text format to factor format usable by naiveBayes method.

4. sink – used to redirect output to file.
5. cat – used to format the output generated.

Analysis.

Object of type naiveBayes generated by the naiveBayes method was observed. It contains conditional probability table of all input data points. However, changing values of Laplace smoothing factor provided no change in accuracy of the output generated. Further investigation required.
