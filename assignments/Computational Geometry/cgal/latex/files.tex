\section{File List}
Here is a list of all documented files with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{algorithm_8h}{algorithm.\+h} \\*Includes three convex hull algorithms It implements Graham scan algorithm, Jarvis march algorithm and Andrew\textquotesingle{}s convex hull algorithm. It also includes cmath library and points header file }{\pageref{algorithm_8h}}{}
