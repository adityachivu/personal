<h2><b>Objective:</b></h2>
<p>
To create a DCEL data structure API to represent Meshes and Subdivisions and perform relevant operations and queries. A new DCEL is initialized by creating an object of class <b>Mesh</b>. Mesh consists of the following classes.
<ol>
	<li>
		HalfEdge
	<li>
		Vertex
	<li>
		Face
	<li>
		EdgeIterator
</ol>
</br>
A brief explanation of the methods defined in Mesh class is as follows:
</p>

<h2><b>Design Principles</b></h2>
<p>
Here we take a look at a breakdown of our code and explain our approach.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>createHalfEdge/ createVertex/ createFace </b></br>
		<p>
			These create the required pointers and push them into the Mesh structure. The Mesh maintains a list of all the Faces and Vertices and HalfEdges in a vector
		</p>
	<li><b>createPolygonMesh</b></br>
		<p>
			This method creates a two-faced (pun intended) Mesh, an exterior and interior face. and updates required HalfEdge and Vertex pointers.
		</p>
	<li><b>triangulate</b></br>
		<p>
			This method first makes a call to makeYmonotone and the triangulates each resulting face.
		</p>
</ul>
