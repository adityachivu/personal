Discrete Structures is a very difficult and competitive course. Therefore, the Course Instructors decided to give every student a unique positive integer grade. Since they are very busy, they want you to make sure the grades they assigned are valid. The number of students registered in the course is M and the number of grades assigned is N.

INPUT:
First line contains value of M and N.
Next M lines contains the grade the corresponding student got.

1 <= M <= 10000
1 <= N <= 10000
1 <= range_of_grades <= N

OUTPUT:
Print “VALID” if it is a valid assignment of grades. Else print “INVALID”

Example 1:
INPUT:
5 5
1
2
3
4
5
 
OUTPUT:

Explanation 1: There are 5 unique grades allotted to five students.

Example 2:
