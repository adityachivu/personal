Pandey and Mishra like to travel a lot to holiday destinations. But they like to have full information of travels before they make a plan. Help them determine the number of paths to go from one place to another within a given number of journeys. V is the number of places and E is the number of connecting roads.
Places are zero-indexed for convenience. The road network is a simple connected graph.

INPUT
Two space separated integers V and E followed by E lines with two space separated integers P1 and P2 representing a road connecting these two nodes. Again, place numbers are zero-indexed.
Next line contains T and J, by t lines of two space separated integers. J is the number of journeys.

2 <= V <= 20
1 <= E <= 190
0 <= P1 <= V
0 <= P2 <= V
1 <= t <= 20
1 <= J <= 10

OUTPUT
For each query print the number of possible paths in a new line.
